<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We downloaded the full dataset from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape, the
largest public opinion survey ever conducted. It includes people in every
congressional district and mid-sized U.S. city in the lead up to the 2020
election. As we are approaching the presidential election date, nearly everyone
worldwide is wondering what will be the result for 2020. We are thinking about
predicting the outcome(whether Trump or Biden will win the election) based on
the data we have right now. Another goal is finding any voting patterns among
these individuals based on their gender, age, education level, and specifically
the census region.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 introduces the
survey data; section 3 establishes the survey methodology, discusses the
multilevel logistic regression model, and discusses essential estimation
techniques; section 4 talks about the result based on our model; section 5
focuses on improvement and weaknesses of our model; section 6 is citation for
this project.</p>

<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The data of this research was collected by Voter Study Group and IPUMS USA.
The survey data from the Voter Study Group was cleaned by selecting related
variables and creating a new numeric variable recording if the survey respondent
will vote for Donald Trump in the year 2020. The target population was all the Americans who are potential voters for the presidential election; the frame
population was American citizens who had the right to vote; and the sampled
population was the people who actually participated in the survey online. We
used a survey study method to conduct the sample, and the post-stratification
data was cleaned by counting the number of people in each cell to result in
the weighted estimating process.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>

<div id="model-specifics" class="section level1">
<h1>Model Specifics</h1>
<p>Due to the interest in the 2020 American presidential election result. This research
chose the Multilevel logistic model to predict election result for each
individual and uses the post-stratification technique to weight the estimates
to return the final prediction of the election outcome since MRP is often used
for dichotomous fixed choice questions. We use this model due to the goal of
estimating the odds that whether Trump will win the election(the yes/no outcome)
while taking the dependency of data into account (the fact that voting intention
is not finalized). Practically, it allows us to estimate such odds as a function
of lower level variables (age, gender), higher level variables (education level,
census regions), and the way they are interrelated.
By fitting in all the variables, we get the
<span class="math display">\[ y_{trump}=\beta_{census.region}+0.547x_{male}+0.076x_{old}-0.43x_{young}-0.02x_{higher.education}\]</span>
where $ <em>{census.region}=-0.46327-0.105w</em>{north}+0.195w_{south}-0.143w_{west}$
We can tell from the beta that gender and age play an important role when
deciding the voting, census_region, also relatively high contribution to the
overall model.</p>
</div>
<div id="post-stratification" class="section level1">
<h1>Post-Stratification</h1>
<p>Poststratification is a popular method for correcting known differences between
sample and target populations (Little, 1993). We post-stratified the census
data responses to mimic the survey sample of likely voters. To make inference
about the population level, we use the result of our model and apply the
probability of voting for Trump to the population level, where <span class="math display">\[y_j\]</span> is the
estimate of y in cell j, and <span class="math inline">\(N_j\)</span> is the size of each <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> cell in the
population. Through the combination of different ages group(young_adults,
middle-aged adults, old adults), citizens(naturalized citizens, not citizens),
gender(male, female), an education level(higher education, no higher education),
and their census region(Midwest, Northeast, South, West), thus partitioning the
data into 96 cells, results in the weighted estimating process. We focus on
these four explanatory variables due to its influence on the voting result. For
instance,we chose the census_region as level 2, because different states have
policies that are more beneficial for specific groups, which will do Trump much
good effects with the electorate. We will transform the result of our model,
for each cell we have <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> to calculate <span class="math display">\[\hat{y^{ps}}=\frac{\sum{N_i}*\hat{y_j}}{\sum{N_i}}\]</span>.
This results in 41.7% supporting Trump, and following a similar process we get
43.4% support for Biden.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 6101 qualified participation in the survey, about 2544 people will vote for
Trump, 2648 will vote for Biden, and 909 citizens will not vote for either of
them. In conclusion, Biden will win the 2020 presidential election.
We found out classifying people according to their age and census_region, both
groups do not have an overall trend toward the model, due to the large p-value.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>We finish the primary goal of estimating whether Trump will win the election.
Besides that, we are also interested in voting patterns based on people’s
classification. The exciting thing is that people with higher education(earn
bachelor or master’s degrees)tend to be against Trump; while individuals who
have lower education levels tend to favor Trump. We choose age and sex as two
strongly correlated explanatory variables to voting preferences, but we are not
sure about other variables. In the beginning, we thought census_region might
make a massive difference between people’s choices, as it turned out, people’s
voting behavior has little relation to their region.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="weaknesses" class="section level1">
<h1>Weaknesses</h1>
<p>Like all the survey estimates, these numbers are subject to a degree of error.
There is an even higher possibility in this case because we are asking
respondents about future plans, which might change. As such, the estimates
should be interpreted with these uncertainties in mind. Specifically, Donald
Trump supporters(registered voters) intend to vote in-person on Election Day,
which is a much higher uncertainty towards the final result.
Since we only use four explanatory variables out of 16 variables we could use,
and the sample size is relatively large, our model is probably underfitting,
too generalized for such a big dataset.</p>
<p>#Next Steps
When the election is done, we will have the finalized data. First we can check
whether we have the correct prediction by our model, we can check this by doing
a post-hoc analysis or another survey of how to better improve estimation for
future elections. Further studies may focus on voting patterns across the
election years. We can check whether people who voted for Trump in 2016 still
voted for Trump in 2020. This can be further analyzed to gain more insight about
how satisfied Trump supporters are regarding the performance of the Trump
administration.</p>
