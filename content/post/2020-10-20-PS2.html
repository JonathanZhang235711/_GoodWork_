<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>People’s reproducing decisions could be quite influential towards family
structure and social development under a more general concept. Therefore, this
research uses survey data from the 2017 Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) to
answer the following questions. How do the income level, number of existing
kids, and couples’ average age influence their willingness to have kids in the
future? More specifically, how do these variables strengthen or weaken couples’
willingness to have a child in the future?After presenting several statistical
models (such as the logistic model), the question was discussed and interpreted
based on the model outcome.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The topic of this study is about whether a family will want a child in the
future(FUTURE_CHILD), considering INCOME, AGE, and TOTAL_CHILDREN as
predictor variables. In the meantime, we can find the most influential factor
in this decision. The insight for this study is based on the diminishing birth
rate year by year, the birth rate for 2017 was only 10.55%, and it has been
decreasing since 2009 right after the financial crisis in 2008, which is the
reason we(this research) include family income as a predictor variable. GSS’s
primary purpose is to
provide information on specific social policy issues. This data analysis will
show the severity of this problem, which would help enact new policies toward
this issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data in this research is the survey data from the 2017 GSS. Combining the
research question following data variables were selected for the first
(logistic) model: respondent’s age, family income, the total number of children
born in the past, and their willingness to have a child in the future. By
omitting each variable’s unknown value, 4086 remaining observations became
accessible for the model(logistic model). During the cleaning process, the
income level was defined from the ‘Income_family’ variable instead of
‘income_respondent’ because, in an existing family, total or average income can
better reflect the financial status than using the estimator’s income. The
dependent variable of ‘future_children_intention’ was modified into a binary
outcome of ‘0’ as ‘probably not’ or ‘definitely not’ to the question and ‘1’
representing ‘probably yes’ and ‘definitely yes’ perform better under a logistic
model. The data could have missed some lurking variables, such as the age of the
existing children. However, the marginal change in willingness dependent on this
variable can be ignored because the combination of age and number of the current
children can indirectly reflect the change in children’s age.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>
<p>This research uses logistic regression to analyze the result, which is a binary
dependent variable (yes or no). It is because the logistic regression model is
used for predictive analysis to explain the relationship between one dependent
binary variable (yes or no) and three nomial variables (age, income level, and
total children).</p>

<p>The regression equation of our study is:
<span class="math display">\[log(p/1-p)= 5.14 - 0.168x_age - 1.110x_total.children - 0.016x_income.level\]</span>
For every additional unit increase in age we expect the log odds of
willingness to have kid to decrease by 0.168.
For every additional unit increase in total_children we expect the log odds of
willingness to have kid to have kid to decrease by 1.110.
For every additional unit increase in income_level we expect the log odds of
willingness to have kid to decrease by 0.016.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The first plot examines the relationship between FUTURE_CHILD and AGE. The
equation is written as the probability of wanting a child in the future. The
response value of 1 on the y-axis represents “yes,” and 0 represents “no”
(same for all four plots, omitted in the following paragraphs). The plot shows
that the probability of wanting a child in the future decreases as the AGE
increases. When the AGE is between 16 to 20, the line’s slope is not very steep,
which indicates that the probability of wanting a child decreases slowly as AGE
increases in this period. The line is more vertical for AGE between 20 to 25,
which suggests a change in the AGE of 1 year has a more massive effect in this
range. When the FUTURE_CHILD goes to zero at the AGE approaches 27, the line
flattens.</p>
<p>The second plot examines the relationship between FUTURE_CHILD and
TOTAL_CHILDREN. The plot shows that the probability of wanting a child in the
future decreases as the TOTAL_CHILDREN increases. When the number of children
in the family is between 0 and 1, the slope of the line is not very steep, which
indicates that the probability of wanting a child decreases slowly among 0 to 1
child. The line is steeper in the TOTAL_CHILDREN between 2 to 3, which indicates
that a change in TOTAL_CHILDREN increased by 1 has a larger effect in this
range. When the FUTURE_CHILD goes to zero at the TOTAL_CHILDREN around 3, the
line flattens.</p>
<p>Last plot examines the relationship between FUTURE_CHILD and INCOME_LEVEL.
The plot shows that the probability of wanting a child in the future decreases
as the INCOME_LEVEL increases. The line is steeper when INCOME_LEVEL is around
less than $25,000 to $74,999, which indicates that the income range between
$25,000 and $74,999 has a larger effect when making the decision of whether to
have a child in the future. When the FUTURE_CHILD goes to zero at the
INCOME_LEVEL beyond $75,000, the line flattens.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The GSS sample is drawn using an area probability design that randomly selects
respondents in households across Canada to participate in the survey. The
general population would be all the Canadians. Respondents that become part of
the GSS sample are from a mix of urban, suburban, and rural geographic areas,
which are the frame population. The GSS uses Statistics Canada’s standard
telephone frame, which combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the
Address Register, the Census of Population, and various administrative sources,
and has been integrated with Statistics Canada’s standard dwelling frame. Last,
the sampled population is the people who actually participated in the survey,
and the size is approximately 20,000 respondents by 2019. Since 2013, GSS has
been collected using a combination of self-completed online questionnaires and
telephone interviews. Participation in the study is strictly voluntary, and the
sample for the GSS is based on the method of cluster sampling, so the standard
errors are larger for the GSS than the simple random sampling. The non-sampling
errors include inadequate frame-coverage error, non-response problem; response
error; interviewer bias; and processing, editing, and entering error.</p>

<div id="weaknesses" class="section level1">
<h1>Weaknesses</h1>
<p>In this survey GSS, most of the data is categorical instead of numerical, which
produces limitation of choices of models. The categorical data type produces
disadvantages, however, considering topic like how a person makes a choice on
the question, a binary outcome is able to explain the case better.</p>
</div>
<div id="next-steps" class="section level1">
<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>Working beyond this research, this data set of GSS can tell more about the
decision-making question of having a child in the future or not. For example,
under measuring the family’s financial status, this research used
‘income_family’. From another perspective, ‘income_respondent’ can be combined
with ‘income_family’ to show how answers differ between the person who bears
more of the family’s financial pressure and the rest of the members. A follow-up
survey could include questions like “Do you feel that you bear more financial
pressure from the family or it is equally shared”. It can tell something about
the lurking variable of their decision to have a child. In the meantime, it also
gives more possibility to provide a weighted stratified sampling based on their
share of family financial pressure.</p>
